# keystroke-biometrics
Keystroke Anomaly detector on CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) dataset using Euclidean Distance in Python

Code is written in Python 3.7.3.
There are two python scripts needs to be run to verify the implementation.

1. keystroke.py  => This file is for keystroke anomaly detector & also identifying user groups
2. gen_algo.py => This file is for Genetic Algorithm implementation

Just run keystroke.py & gen.algo.py and it will execute the main function
and you can see the output of eveything which was asked in the assignment description.

Following Libraries needs to be installed on the system to run the scripts successfully

numpy
pandas
sklearn
math
random

Dataset is already kept in the dataset directory. Scripts will load the data from that directory and start performing operations
